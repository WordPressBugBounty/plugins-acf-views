== Description ==

Display content with full control over selection and layout. Lightweight and compatible with any theme or page builder.

==⭐ Why Choose Advanced Views?==

Advanced Views is a framework that empowers you to craft layouts and selections that you miss, without bloatware or heavy dependencies.

✅ **Solid by design**: craft modular and reusable layouts. Eliminate replications, style conflicts, and avoid messy code snippets.
✅ **Content-driven**: pull content dynamically, with granular filtering and sorting options, built on top of the native WordPress Query. Master advanced database queries with post fields, taxonomies, and meta values.
✅ **Time-saver**: automate the groundwork and data fetching. Focus on creating while leaving typical routines behind.
✅ **Fully customizable**: directly access the template code to create advanced elements, like Grids and Sliders, and harness your theme styles and scripts.
✅ **Easy to embed**: copy and paste a native WordPress shortcode to add layouts anywhere.

==🧩 Plenty of Use Cases==

Custom fields and Post Types are essential to WordPress. Advanced Views natively supports them – giving you the freedom to pull, mix, and combine them in a common layout.

Popular scenarios include:

**Displaying custom fields:**

🔹On a single page: to enrich landing page sections
🔹CPT-wide: estimated delivery time for all Products
🔹Site-wide: contact details from the Options page
🔹User-specific: fields of the current user in a custom banner or profile page

**Displaying Posts, Products and CPT:**

🔹Posts: blog posts from a specific category
🔹WooCommerce: related Products in a grid or carousel
🔹Event lists: Show upcoming events, hide past events
🔹Real Estate listings: properties by location, size, or type
🔹Locations map: display all pick-up location markers on a single map
🔹Reviews and Comments: product reviews or user comments

==🔗 Multiple Content Sources==

Advanced Views is vendor-independent and plugin-agnostic - so it will work with WordPress Posts, WooCommerce Products, and any CPT on your website.

Learn it once and use it everywhere with built-in support for:

🔹All Custom Post Types registered in WordPress
🔹[WordPress post fields](https://wplake.gitbook.io/advanced-views/getting-started/supported-data-vendors#id-1.-wordpress) (title, featured image, author, taxonomy terms...)
🔹[Woo Product fields](https://wplake.gitbook.io/advanced-views/getting-started/supported-data-vendors#id-2.-woocoomerce-plugin) (price, sku, stock status, weight...)
🔹[Advanced Custom Fields](https://wplake.gitbook.io/advanced-views/getting-started/supported-data-vendors#id-3.-advanced-custom-fields-plugin) (whether it’s text, select, image, gallery, repeater or relationship)

🔹[Pods fields](https://wplake.gitbook.io/advanced-views/getting-started/supported-data-vendors#id-5.-pods-plugin) (from WYSIWYG, price, date and time... )

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I display fields from user profile, taxonomy term or options page? =

Advanced Views supports all the field sources provided by your chosen meta vendor.

For example, if you're using ACF (Advanced Custom Fields), you can access fields from option pages, user profiles, terms, comments, and menus.

You can refer to the [documentation](https://docs.advanced-views.com/getting-started/supported-data-vendors) for the specific list of supported field sources for your meta vendor.

= Can I display fields inside the Gutenberg Query Loop? =

You can use the View shortcode inside the Gutenberg Query Loop element.

Please make sure you've added it via the built-in Shortcode block, as it won't work properly with other block types, like Code or Custom HTML.

= Does the plugin have a Git repository? =

Yes, we maintain an [official Git repository](https://github.com/wplake/advanced-views-framework).
You're welcome to open issues or PRs there.
